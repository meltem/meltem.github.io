Hello!! Welcome to my website!!!

Here I delve deep into what it means to be human. While we are seemingly capable of experiencing a wide range of emotions and thoughts what *-if anything-* makes us different than today's large language models (LLMs)? 

In this journey, I'll go over most impactful social experiments, and strategies to evaluate the performance of LLMs to answer these questions. I will talk with various chatbots like Chat-GPT and Bard to see what they are thinking about the topic at hand. 
I'll also visit scientific research and philosophical theories that shed light on the complexities of the human experience.

Whether you're interested in artificial intelligence,sociology, psychology, anthropology or philosophy you are at the right place. Join me on this journey of self-discovery as I explore what is the way for one to verify they are human.

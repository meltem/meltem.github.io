Hello! Welcome to my website!

Here, I delve deep into what it means to be human. While we are seemingly capable of experiencing a wide range of emotions and thoughts, what - if anything - makes us different from today's large language models (LLMs)?

On this journey, I'll explore the most impactful social experiments and strategies to evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering these questions. I will converse with various chatbots like Chat-GPT and Bard to see what they think about the topic at hand. Additionally, I'll explore scientific research and philosophical theories that shed light on the complexities of the human experience.

Whether you're interested in artificial intelligence, sociology, psychology, anthropology, or philosophy, you've come to the right place. Join me on this journey of self-discovery as I explore what it means to be human and how one can verify their humanity.

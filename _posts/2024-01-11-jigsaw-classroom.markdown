The Jigsaw Classroom, developed by psychologist Elliot Aronson in 1971, is a cooperative learning technique designed to reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations in the classroom. The Jigsaw Classroom involves breaking students into small, diverse groups where each member is responsible for learning specific material and then teaching it to their groupmates, fostering collaboration and interdependence.

**Aim**: The Jigsaw Classroom aimed to promote positive intergroup relations and reduce prejudice by creating opportunities for cooperative learning and collaboration among students from diverse backgrounds.

**Method**: Aronson developed the Jigsaw Classroom technique based on principles of social interdependence and cooperative learning. Students are divided into small, heterogeneous groups where each member is assigned a unique piece of information or task. They then collaborate to learn and teach each other their respective pieces, fostering mutual understanding and cooperation.

**Results**: The Jigsaw Classroom has been shown to improve academic performance, increase empathy and understanding among students, and reduce prejudice and stereotypes. By promoting interdependence and collaboration, the technique creates a supportive and inclusive learning environment where students feel valued and respected for their contributions.

**Factors identified**: The effectiveness of the Jigsaw Classroom depends on factors such as the structure of the groups, the nature of the tasks assigned, the level of interdependence among group members, and the support of the teacher and school administration.

**Conclusion**: The Jigsaw Classroom has significant implications for promoting positive social dynamics and academic achievement in diverse educational settings. By fostering cooperation and empathy, it helps break down barriers between students from different backgrounds and promotes a culture of inclusivity and mutual respect.

**Criticisms**: While the Jigsaw Classroom has been widely praised for its effectiveness in promoting positive intergroup relations, critics have raised concerns about its implementation and the need for ongoing support and training for teachers. Some argue that the technique may be challenging to implement consistently and effectively in all classroom contexts.

**Legacy**: The Jigsaw Classroom has had a lasting impact on educational practices and social psychology research. It has inspired further research into cooperative learning techniques and interventions aimed at reducing prejudice and promoting positive intergroup relations in schools and other settings.

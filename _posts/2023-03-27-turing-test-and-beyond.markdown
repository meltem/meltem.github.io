I have a t-shirt I purchased in 2003 that says "I've failed the Turing test" on the front. Even back then, I was fascinated with the topic of human behavior, and wondered if we are just mere robots with complex machinery.

With the pace of AI development, my interest has expanded to the concept of consciousness - what it is, how we define it, and how we can test for it.

Currently, there are several techniques and tests proposed to assess an AI's level of consciousness. The most well-known approach is the Turing Test, which involves a human evaluator engaging in a natural language conversation with both a human and an AI, and then trying to determine which one is the AI. The AI needs to convincingly mimic human-like responses and behaviors to pass the test.

Another approach is to use cognitive tests that assess an individual's level of consciousness and awareness, and then compare an AI's performance to these models to see how well it performs against human tasks.

Today, we will look at such cognitive tests that are currently being used to benchmark AI and how current LLM models perform against them.

The Pygmalion Effect, also known as the Rosenthal-Jacobson effect, refers to the phenomenon where higher expectations lead to an increase in performance.

**Aim**: The Pygmalion Effect experiment aimed to investigate how expectations influence the performance of individuals.

**Method**: In the study conducted by psychologists Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson in 1968, teachers were told that certain students in their class were "academic spurters" and were expected to have significant intellectual growth in the coming year. However, these students were selected at random. The experimenters wanted to see if the teachers' expectations would influence the students' actual performance.

**Results**: At the end of the school year, the researchers found that the students labeled as academic spurters showed significantly greater intellectual gains compared to their peers. This finding suggested that the teachers' expectations had influenced the students' performance, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Factors identified**: The Pygmalion Effect highlighted the importance of expectations in shaping behavior and performance. It showed that individuals' beliefs about themselves and others can have a significant impact on outcomes.

**Conclusion**: The Pygmalion Effect has important implications for education, leadership, and interpersonal relationships. It underscores the power of expectations in influencing behavior and highlights the need for positive reinforcement and high expectations in fostering success.

**Criticisms**: While the Pygmalion Effect has been widely observed in various contexts, critics have raised concerns about its replicability and the potential for bias in interpreting results. Some argue that factors other than expectations may have influenced the outcomes observed in the study.

**Legacy**: The Pygmalion Effect has had a significant influence on research in psychology and education. It has led to further investigations into the mechanisms underlying expectancy effects and interventions aimed at harnessing the power of positive expectations to improve outcomes in various settings.
